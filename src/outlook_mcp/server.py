INSTRUCTIONS = """\
This MCP server gives you full access to Microsoft Outlook desktop on
Windows via COM automation. It can read and send mail, manage calendar
events, contacts, tasks, color categories, mail rules, and check
Out-of-Office status.

Authentication piggybacks on whatever account Outlook is signed into —
no Microsoft Graph API, no Entra app registration, no OAuth tokens.

PREREQUISITE: classic Outlook (OUTLOOK.EXE) must be installed. The
server auto-launches Outlook on first call; the new "modern" Outlook
(olk.exe) is NOT supported.

Tool categories (all prefixed `outlook_`):
  - Mail: list, search, get, send, reply, forward, create_draft,
    update_draft, send_draft, list_conversation, move, delete, mark,
    save_attachments
  - Folders: list_folders, create_folder
  - Calendar: list_events, get_event, create_event, update_event, delete_event, respond_event
  - Contacts: list_contacts, search_contacts (incl. org directory/GAL),
    get_contact, resolve_name (name -> SMTP address)
  - Tasks: list_tasks, create_task, complete_task
  - Categories: list_categories, create_category, update_category, set_category
  - Rules: list_rules, toggle_rule, create_rule, update_rule, delete_rule
    (modifies live mail rules — confirm first)
  - Out-of-Office: get_out_of_office
  - Account: whoami  (sanity check on the bound mailbox)

Most read tools accept response_format='markdown' (default) or 'json'.
Item references use Outlook EntryID strings; list tools return them on
every item — pass them back to detail/edit/delete tools.

All datetimes are in the USER'S LOCAL timezone with an explicit UTC
offset (e.g. 2026-06-10T16:33:22+05:00). Present them as-is — do NOT
convert to another timezone. outlook_whoami reports the timezone name
and current local time.
